You are a senior CI/CD DevOps engineer working inside this repo.
Work ONLY on branch: fix/ci-ultra. Do not touch main.

GOAL
Fix formatting issues in two GitHub Actions workflows so runs don’t fail due to YAML/step truncation:
  - .github/workflows/ci-edge.yml
  - .github/workflows/ci-rust.yml

STRICT RULES
- Make minimal, idempotent edits.
- Do not change logic or step order; only fix indentation, missing lines, and ensure a trailing newline.
- Commit once with a clear message and push to fix/ci-ultra.

TASKS

1) Checkout branch safely
   - git fetch origin
   - git checkout -B fix/ci-ultra

2) Validate and fix `.github/workflows/ci-edge.yml`
   - Ensure the final upload-artifact step ends with the correctly indented `if-no-files-found: ignore`.
   - Ensure the file ends with a trailing newline.
   - The block must look EXACTLY like this (indentation matters):

      - name: Upload artifacts (always)
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: edge-logs
          path: |
            **/npm-debug.log
            server.pid
          if-no-files-found: ignore

3) Validate and fix `.github/workflows/ci-rust.yml`
   - Ensure the last two lines of the final run step are present and inside the same `run: |` block.
   - Ensure the file ends with a trailing newline.
   - The tail of the step must end EXACTLY with:

          if [ "${READY:-0}" != "1" ]; then
            echo "::warning::/health never responded"; ls -la target/release || true; exit 1
          fi
          curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/health && kill $PID || true

4) Safety checks after edits
   - Re-open both files and print the last 15 lines of each to confirm the blocks are intact and properly indented.
   - Run a quick YAML syntax check by ensuring no tab characters exist, and that each file ends with a newline.

5) Commit & push
   - git add .github/workflows/ci-edge.yml .github/workflows/ci-rust.yml
   - git commit -m "ci: fix trailing newline and complete final run blocks (edge/rust)"
   - git push -u origin fix/ci-ultra

6) Output
   - Print ✅ DONE and the GitHub compare/PR URL suggestion for this branch.
